/**
 * Outer restart loop for the api with a built-in file watcher.
 *
 * Replaces the previous `tsx watch` default, which has a fatal hang when
 * its child crashes during *startup* (vs. while running). That hang shows
 * up reliably in the wild: any time prc-loop.sh's git puller pulls a PR
 * that touches multiple files, tsx watch sees an `unlink` event mid-pull,
 * triggers a restart, and the restarted child crashes when tsx's loader
 * tries to read package.json while git is mid-rewrite. tsx watch then
 * stays alive forever waiting for the next file event; no auto-retry.
 *
 * This script:
 *
 *   1. Spawns the api as a child process with stdio inherited.
 *   2. Watches src/server/** with node's built-in fs.watch(recursive:true)
 *      plus a debounce window that's longer than a typical `git pull`'s
 *      multi-file rewrite burst. Concurrent rapid changes coalesce into a
 *      single restart.
 *   3. On debounced change: SIGTERM the child. The api's existing detach
 *      handler in http-api-server.ts releases pirpc supervisors gracefully
 *      so active sessions survive.
 *   4. On child exit — whether from SIGTERM, EADDRINUSE, startup parse
 *      error, or anything else — sleep RESTART_DELAY_MS and respawn. This
 *      is the key invariant that's broken with `tsx watch`: failures
 *      ALWAYS lead to "retry in N ms" eventually. Never hang.
 *   5. On SIGTERM/SIGINT to ourselves: kill the child and exit.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/dev-api.mjs -- <command...>
 *   e.g.  node scripts/dev-api.mjs -- npm run dev:api
 *
 * Env:
 *   DEV_API_DEBOUNCE_MS   debounce window in ms (default 500)
 *   DEV_API_RESTART_MS    delay before respawn after exit (default 800)

 * Detect and repair a node_modules tree that's been clobbered such that

 * Returns true if a heal was actually performed (caller should schedule
 * a respawn after a short delay so the fresh node_modules has time to
 * materialize).
 *
 * Two known pathological states, both observed multiple times in 24h:
 *
 *   (A) `node_modules` itself is a self-referential symlink:
 *         $ ls -la node_modules
 *         lrwxrwxrwx ... node_modules -> ../<this-dir-name>/node_modules
 *       Root cause: an agent ran `ln -s ../pi-remote-control/node_modules
 *       node_modules` from INSIDE the canonical worktree (the recipe is
 *       correct for sibling worktrees but loops on the canonical one).
 *
 *   (B) `node_modules` is a normal directory but contains a nested
 *       symlink that ELOOPs (e.g. `node_modules/tsx` → `../tsx` from a
 *       half-finished install, or any other bad symlink). The previous
 *       version of this heal bailed early via `!stat.isSymbolicLink()`
 *       and the supervisor would sit in `Will retry` forever with no
 *       API up. Observed 2026-05-23: a 33-minute outage where `dev:api`
 *       loop-spammed `spawn() threw synchronously: spawn ELOOP. Will
 *       retry.` until a human ran `npm install` manually.
 *
 * Heal procedure:
 *   - Case (A): unlink the bad symlink, then `npm install`.
 *   - Case (B): just `npm install` (it'll repair whatever's broken).
 * `npm install` is the same thing a human would do; we just do it
 * automatically because the same mistakes recur often enough that
 * paying the ~7s warm-cache cost is much cheaper than a human-in-the-loop.
 *
 * A small cooldown prevents tight respawn → spawn ELOOP → heal → respawn
 * loops if `npm install` itself can't fix the underlying breakage.
