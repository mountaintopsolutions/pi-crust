# Slash Command WUI Implementation Plan

Plan for implementing the remaining Pi TUI slash-command behavior in `pi-remote-control` while reusing existing web UI pieces and translating Pi terminal UI concepts into web-native dialogs, panels, and actions.

## Current state

The WUI already has a useful foundation:

- `PromptComposer` routes any input beginning with `/` to `SessionDashboard.onSlashCommand` instead of sending it to Pi as a normal prompt.
- `SessionDashboard` currently implements:
  - `/model` and alias `/models` by opening `ModelPicker`
  - `/session` and alias `/info` as a notice
  - `/new` via the existing create-session flow
  - `/name <name>` via `renameSession`
  - `/quit` and alias `/close` via the delete/close affordance
  - `/help` and `/hotkeys` as a notice
- Several parity-oriented components already exist but are not yet wired into the dashboard:
  - `ConfigurationPanel`
  - `SessionTree`
  - `ProjectExplorer`
  - `ShortcutHelp`
  - `ModelPicker`
  - `ExtensionUiHost`
  - `MessageTimeline` / `ToolCard`
- `src/shared/protocol.ts` already defines many operations needed for parity, including `compact`, `get_commands`, `fork`, `clone`, `switch_session`, and `export_html`, but the HTTP API and adapter do not yet expose most of them.

## TUI commands to cover

Public built-ins from Pi TUI:

| Command | TUI behavior | Current WUI status | Target WUI behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/settings` | Open settings selector | Suggested but not implemented | Open configuration/settings modal or side panel |
| `/model [query]` | Open model selector, optionally prefiltered | Partially implemented | Reuse `ModelPicker`, support query prefill |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for cycling | Not implemented | Model-scope multi-select modal inside config |
| `/export [path]` | Export HTML by default, JSONL by extension | Not implemented | Export dialog with default path and download/open result |
| `/import <path>` | Import JSONL and resume | Not implemented | Import dialog with path picker/text field and session activation |
| `/share` | Export/share as secret GitHub gist | Not implemented | Either explicit non-goal or guarded share dialog |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message | Not implemented | Clipboard action with toast |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name | Implemented | Keep; also add input dialog for bare `/name` |
| `/session` | Show session info/stats | Minimal notice | Rich session info modal using stats |
| `/changelog` | Show changelog entries | Not implemented | Markdown modal showing Pi/package changelog |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts | Minimal notice + `?` dialog | Open `ShortcutHelp` programmatically or unify help modal |
| `/fork` | Select previous user message and fork to new file | Not implemented | Fork-message picker using `SessionTree`/selector |
| `/clone` | Duplicate current active branch into new session | Not implemented | Confirmation + adapter clone op + activate new session |
| `/tree` | Navigate current session tree | Suggested but not implemented | Open `SessionTree` modal backed by server tree API |
| `/login` | Configure provider auth | Not implemented | Auth modal using config panel/auth flow |
| `/logout` | Remove provider auth | Not implemented | Auth modal or provider selector + confirmation |
| `/new` | Start fresh session | Implemented as create session | Keep; confirm if current active session is streaming |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Manual compaction | Suggested but not implemented | Compact dialog/action with progress, custom instructions |
| `/resume` | Browse/select saved sessions | Not implemented as slash command | Open session picker and activate selected session |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings/extensions/skills/prompts/themes | Not implemented | Resource reload action with diagnostics |
| `/quit` | Quit app | WUI close/delete analog | Clarify semantics: close/dispose session vs disconnect |

Hidden/debug TUI commands (`/debug`, `/arminsayshi`, `/dementedelves`) should remain out of WUI parity unless explicitly needed for development.

Dynamic commands also need support:

- Prompt template commands loaded from `.pi/prompts` / user prompts
- Extension commands registered by `pi.registerCommand`
- Skill commands such as `/skill:<name>` when enabled

These should be discovered through `get_commands` and executed through the normal Pi prompt path, not hardcoded as WUI built-ins.

## Key design principle: translate, do not embed, TUI components

Pi TUI components are terminal components: they render fixed-width ANSI lines and handle raw key input. The WUI should not try to mount those components directly in the browser. Instead, translate their interaction patterns into reusable React components:

| TUI pattern/component | Web translation | Candidate existing/reusable WUI component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SelectList` / selector dialogs | Searchable list modal with keyboard + touch support | New `SearchableSelectDialog`; reuse `ModelPicker` patterns |
| `SettingsList` | Settings/config side panel with toggles/selects | `ConfigurationPanel`, expanded and integrated |
| `BorderedLoader` | Blocking/non-blocking progress modal or toast with abort | New `ProgressDialog` / existing notices |
| `LoginDialog` / `OAuthSelector` | Auth provider modal + API key/OAuth states | `ConfigurationPanel` auth section |
| `ModelSelectorComponent` | Searchable model modal | `ModelPicker` |
| `ScopedModelsSelectorComponent` | Multi-select model modal | Extend `ModelPicker` or new `ScopedModelsDialog` |
| `SessionSelectorComponent` | Session resume picker | Existing session sidebar + new `ResumeSessionDialog` |
| `TreeSelectorComponent` | Branch tree modal/side panel | `SessionTree` |
| `UserMessageSelectorComponent` | Fork-from-message picker | Reuse `SearchableSelectDialog` or `SessionTree` filtered to user entries |
| `Markdown` | Markdown modal/document viewer | New `MarkdownDialog` |
| `ctx.ui.confirm/input/editor/select` | Generic extension/WUI dialogs | `ExtensionUiHost` plus shared dialog primitives |

The reusable target is a small WUI dialog toolkit rather than one-off command UIs.

## Architecture changes

### 1. Replace the hardcoded slash switch with a command registry

Create a browser-side command registry, for example:

```text
src/web/commands/
  slash-command-registry.ts
  builtin-slash-commands.ts
  slash-command-types.ts
```

Suggested types:

```ts
interface SlashCommandDefinition {
  name: string;
  aliases?: readonly string[];
  description: string;
  source: "wui-built-in" | "pi-built-in" | "extension" | "prompt" | "skill";
  argumentHint?: string;
  available?: (ctx: CommandContext) => boolean;
  run: (ctx: CommandContext, argv: string) => Promise<void> | void;
}
```

Goals:

- Centralize command metadata for autocomplete, `/help`, and dispatch.
- Keep WUI built-ins separate from dynamic Pi commands.
- Allow commands to open modals, call APIs, set notices, or pass through to Pi.
- Make `/help` render from the registry instead of a hardcoded string.

### 2. Expand the WUI API surface

Extend `SessionDashboardApi` and `HttpSessionDashboardApi` with focused methods instead of routing everything through `prompt`:

```ts
compact(sessionId, customInstructions?)
exportSession(sessionId, outputPath?, format?)
importSession(path, cwd?)
getSessionStats(sessionId)
getLastAssistantText(sessionId)
getCommands(sessionId)
getSessionTree(sessionId)
navigateTree(sessionId, entryId, options)
forkSession(sessionId, entryId)
cloneSession(sessionId)
resumeSession(sessionFile)
reloadResources(sessionId?)
listAuthProviders()
loginProvider(provider, options)
logoutProvider(provider)
listSettings()
updateSetting(key, value)
listScopedModels(sessionId)
setScopedModels(sessionId, models)
```

Keep path-sensitive operations behind server-side allowlists:

- Import/export paths must pass explicit policy checks.
- Session files must stay under allowed session roots.
- Project/cwd operations must stay under allowed project roots.
- Sharing must be opt-in and should clearly disclose what leaves the machine.

### 3. Extend the Pi adapter boundary

`PiSessionHandle` currently covers only state, messages, prompting, abort, naming, and model selection. Add capabilities in small groups:

```ts
interface PiSessionHandle {
  compact(customInstructions?: string): Promise<CompactionResult>;
  exportHtml(outputPath?: string): Promise<{ path: string }>;
  getLastAssistantText(): Promise<string | null>;
  getStats(): Promise<SessionStatsDetail>;
  getCommands(): Promise<readonly SlashCommandInfo[]>;
  getTree(): Promise<SessionTreeData>;
  navigateTree(entryId: string, options: NavigateTreeOptions): Promise<NavigateTreeResult>;
  fork(entryId: string): Promise<ForkResult>;
  clone(): Promise<CloneResult>;
  reloadResources(): Promise<ResourceReloadResult>;
}
```

For `SdkPiAdapter`, many of these map directly to SDK/RPC concepts:

- `session.compact(customInstructions)` for `/compact`
- `session.exportToHtml` or exported session utilities for `/export`
- `session.messages` for `/copy` and stats
- `pi.getCommands()` / RPC `get_commands` equivalent for dynamic commands
- `AgentSessionRuntime` for replacement flows: `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/clone`, `/import`
- `session.navigateTree(...)` and `SessionManager.getTree()` for `/tree`
- `SettingsManager`, `AuthStorage`, `ModelRegistry`, and `DefaultResourceLoader.reload()` for settings/auth/reload

Important adapter decision:

- The current WUI is multi-session, while Pi TUI has one active runtime that gets replaced for `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/clone`, and `/import`.
- For simple WUI behavior, these commands can create/open/activate sessions in the dashboard.
- For exact extension lifecycle behavior, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and preserve the same lifecycle events Pi TUI emits. This is especially important for extension hooks like `session_before_switch`, `session_before_fork`, and `session_shutdown`.

Recommended approach:

1. Implement non-replacement commands with the existing per-session handle.
2. Introduce a runtime-aware adapter for tree/fork/clone/import/resume once the simpler commands are stable.
3. Keep the mock adapter feature-complete enough for unit/e2e tests.

### 4. Prefer WebSocket/RPC-compatible operation names

`src/shared/protocol.ts` already models a richer Pi-like protocol than the current HTTP API. Avoid inventing incompatible names. The HTTP endpoints can be REST-shaped, but internally they should map to the same operation names:

- `compact`
- `get_commands`
- `fork`
- `clone`
- `get_fork_messages`
- `switch_session`
- `export_html`
- `set_thinking_level`
- `cycle_thinking_level`

This makes it easier to move the browser from HTTP+SSE to WebSocket later.

## Command-by-command implementation notes

### `/settings`

Reuse:

- `ConfigurationPanel`
- `ModelPicker` for model sub-flow
- `ShortcutHelp`/hotkey data

Needed:

- Integrate `ConfigurationPanel` into `SessionDashboard` as a modal/side sheet.
- Add server endpoints for settings read/update.
- Add resource diagnostics and theme lists from Pi resource loader/settings manager.
- Split the current all-in-one `ConfigurationPanel` into tabs if it becomes too large: Auth, Models, Tools, Settings, Resources, Packages, Themes.

First cut:

- Open configuration panel with currently mocked/static data replaced by real models and basic settings.
- Make unsafe package management controls read-only or hidden until package security work is done.

### `/model [query]`

Reuse:

- `ModelPicker`

Needed:

- Add optional initial search query prop to `ModelPicker`.
- Parse `/model sonnet` and prefill search with `sonnet`.
- Show unavailable models with reasons if `ModelRegistry` can expose them.
- Update active session state after selection.

### `/scoped-models`

Reuse:

- `ModelPicker` filtering/search UI
- `ConfigurationPanel` model section

Needed:

- Multi-select model dialog.
- Server support for enabled/scoped model list.
- Persist to Pi settings where appropriate.
- Clarify WUI equivalent of TUI model cycling if cycling shortcuts are added later.

### `/compact [instructions]`

Reuse:

- Notice/progress UI
- `MessageTimeline` support for compaction summary events

Needed:

- Add adapter `compact` method.
- Add `/api/sessions/:id/compact`.
- Show a confirmation or editor dialog when no inline instructions are supplied.
- Show progress while compacting; support abort if SDK exposes abort compaction.
- Refresh messages/state after completion.

First cut:

- `/compact` opens a small dialog with optional custom instructions.
- `/compact focus on files` starts immediately with those instructions.

### `/session`

Reuse:

- Existing session card data
- `RemoteStatusPanel` patterns if useful

Needed:

- Server `get_session_stats` endpoint.
- Modal showing session file, cwd, id, name, model, message counts, token usage, cost, context usage, hot/cold status.
- Copy buttons for session ID/file path.

### `/copy`

Reuse:

- Browser clipboard API
- Existing notice/toast

Needed:

- API method `getLastAssistantText(sessionId)` or compute from loaded messages.
- Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText` with fallback to selection/download.
- Notice on success/failure.

This is a good early command because it is mostly client-side.

### `/hotkeys` and `/help`

Reuse:

- `ShortcutHelp`
- New command registry metadata

Needed:

- Let `ShortcutHelp` be opened programmatically, not only with `?`.
- `/help` should show a command palette/help dialog generated from the registry plus dynamic `get_commands` results.
- `/hotkeys` should show keyboard shortcuts; `/help` should show commands and shortcuts.

### `/changelog`

Reuse:

- New `MarkdownDialog`

Needed:

- Server endpoint to expose Pi changelog and app version/changelog.
- Render markdown safely. Avoid raw HTML unless sanitized.

First cut:

- Display `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md` text through a server endpoint.

### `/tree`

Reuse:

- `SessionTree`

Needed:

- Adapter support for `SessionManager.getTree()`, labels, current leaf, and tree navigation.
- API methods:
  - `getSessionTree(sessionId)`
  - `navigateTree(sessionId, entryId, { summary, customInstructions, label })`
  - `setTreeLabel(sessionId, entryId, label?)`
- Convert Pi session entries to `SessionTreeEntry`.
- Show branch-summary choices using existing `SessionTree` controls.
- After navigating to a user/custom message, prefill `PromptComposer` with restored text.

Implementation detail:

- The existing `SessionTree` component already models filters, labels, fork, clone, navigation, and custom summary instructions. Start by wiring it into a modal and backing it with mock adapter data.

### `/fork`

Reuse:

- `SessionTree` filtered to user entries, or a new `SearchableSelectDialog`
- Existing session activation/list refresh logic

Needed:

- API `getForkMessages(sessionId)`.
- API `forkSession(sessionId, entryId)`.
- Activate the created fork session and prefill the selected user message if Pi returns it.
- Respect extension cancellation when runtime-aware adapter exists.

### `/clone`

Reuse:

- Confirmation dialog
- Existing create/open session UI patterns

Needed:

- API `cloneSession(sessionId)`.
- Activate new cloned session.
- Show cancellation/error states.

### `/resume`

Reuse:

- Existing session sidebar search/sort/filter behavior
- New `ResumeSessionDialog` extracted from sidebar logic if needed

Needed:

- Slash command opens a session picker focused on the current project/session root.
- Selecting a session calls existing open/cold-session path or new `switch_session` operation.
- Decide whether `/resume` means “activate in dashboard” or “replace the active Pi runtime.” For WUI multi-session, activation is acceptable for first cut; for exact Pi lifecycle, use runtime switch.

### `/new`

Reuse:

- Existing create session dialog

Needed:

- If active session is streaming, warn or queue action.
- Optionally copy current cwd as default.
- If runtime-aware adapter is adopted, expose Pi `new_session` semantics as distinct from dashboard “create a brand-new independent session.”

### `/export [path]`

Reuse:

- New `ExportDialog`
- Browser download link

Needed:

- API `exportSession(sessionId, outputPath?, format?)`.
- HTML default. Consider JSONL once adapter can export raw session file safely.
- If no path supplied, server can create a file under a configured export directory and return a path/URL.
- Browser download endpoint should stream the generated file.

Security:

- Do not let browser write arbitrary host paths by default.
- Prefer a configured export root or generated temp file.

### `/import <path>`

Reuse:

- New `ImportDialog`
- Existing session activation

Needed:

- Server path policy for import file.
- Adapter/runtime support for `importFromJsonl`.
- Error UI for invalid/missing JSONL.
- After import, list/activate imported session.

First cut:

- Text path field only. Browser file upload can come later if useful.

### `/share`

Needed decision:

- Either declare explicit non-goal for private self-hosted WUI, or implement behind a clear opt-in setting.

If implemented:

- Confirmation dialog describing exactly what will be uploaded.
- GitHub token/auth state checks.
- Server endpoint wrapping Pi share/export behavior.
- Audit log entry.

Recommendation:

- Mark as deferred/non-goal until local parity is complete.

### `/login` and `/logout`

Reuse:

- `ConfigurationPanel` auth section
- `ExtensionUiHost` dialog primitives if OAuth/API key flows use extension UI requests

Needed:

- Server provider auth inventory from `ModelRegistry`/`AuthStorage`.
- API key save/remove operations.
- OAuth initiation and callback/code flow. If Pi SDK exposes provider OAuth callbacks, translate those to web dialogs.
- Warnings for subscription/extra-usage auth.

First cut:

- `/login` opens Configuration/Auth tab.
- `/logout` opens provider selector + confirmation.
- API-key based providers first; OAuth second.

### `/reload`

Reuse:

- `ConfigurationPanel` resource diagnostics section

Needed:

- Adapter/resource-loader reload method.
- API `reloadResources(sessionId?)` returning diagnostics for extensions, skills, prompts, themes, context files.
- Refresh command suggestions after reload by calling `get_commands`.
- Refresh theme/settings/model data.

### Dynamic extension/prompt/skill commands

Reuse:

- Existing `PromptComposer` slash routing
- `ExtensionUiHost` for extension UI requests

Needed:

- Add `getCommands(sessionId)` to API.
- Merge built-in WUI commands and dynamic commands for autocomplete.
- If a slash command is not a WUI built-in but exists in dynamic commands, pass it through to `api.prompt(sessionId, originalText)` so Pi expands/executes it.
- If a slash command is neither built-in nor dynamic, show an unknown-command message with a suggestion to send as plain text.

Important:

- Pi docs say built-in interactive commands are not included in `get_commands`; WUI must keep its own built-in registry.
- Dynamic extension commands can trigger UI requests. Ensure `ExtensionUiHost` is connected to the active session event stream before enabling this broadly.

## Reusable WUI components to create or extract

### `DialogShell`

Shared modal shell with:

- title
- close button
- mobile-friendly layout
- escape/click-outside handling
- focus trap
- optional footer actions

Use for model picker, settings, tree, export/import, compact, session info, command help.

### `SearchableSelectDialog`

Web translation of TUI `SelectList`:

- query field
- keyboard navigation
- touch-friendly rows
- optional descriptions/badges
- empty state
- async loading/error state

Use for `/resume`, `/fork`, `/login` provider choice, `/logout` provider choice, command palette/help.

### `ConfirmDialog`, `InputDialog`, `EditorDialog`

Shared with `ExtensionUiHost` if possible.

Use for:

- `/compact` instructions
- `/name` bare invocation
- `/clone` confirmation
- `/share` confirmation
- `/import` path
- extension UI requests

### `MarkdownDialog`

Use for:

- `/changelog`
- export preview/help
- rich command docs

### `ProgressDialog` / operation toast

Use for:

- compaction
- export/import
- reload
- share
- OAuth waiting states

Should support cancellation when backend supports it.

## Suggested implementation phases

Implement by dependency/risk order rather than by TUI command order. The early phases should create reusable command and dialog infrastructure; later phases should tackle SDK/runtime replacement, auth, and sharing risks.

### Phase 1 — Slash-command foundation

Purpose: establish the reusable WUI command surface before adding many individual commands.

Deliverables:

- Add `src/web/commands/` with:
  - slash command parser
  - command registry
  - built-in command metadata
  - alias resolution
  - unknown-command handling
  - dynamic command metadata shape
- Replace the hardcoded `SessionDashboard.handleSlashCommand` switch with registry dispatch.
- Drive command autocomplete and `/help` from registry metadata.
- Add shared WUI primitives:
  - `DialogShell`
  - `SearchableSelectDialog`
  - `ConfirmDialog`
  - `InputDialog`
  - `MarkdownDialog`
- Keep dynamic command discovery mocked or optional; do not require real SDK `get_commands` yet.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/help`
- `/hotkeys` shell/opening behavior if easy
- improved `/model [query]` opening behavior, without needing settings/auth work

Tests:

- `slash-command-parser.test.ts`
- `slash-command-registry.test.ts`
- dialog primitive tests with accessibility assertions
- `SessionDashboard` tests proving `/help` and `/model <query>` are intercepted and not sent to Pi as prompts

Exit criteria:

- Adding a new WUI slash command is a small registry entry plus optional UI/API method.
- Command help/autocomplete are metadata-driven.

### Phase 2 — Low-risk client/UI commands

Purpose: get visible parity wins using existing client state, browser APIs, or read-only panels.

Deliverables:

- Wire existing components into command-opened modals/panels.
- Add lightweight APIs only where needed.
- Avoid deep SDK/runtime replacement semantics.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/copy`
- `/session`
- `/name` bare invocation as an input dialog; keep `/name <name>` immediate
- `/settings` opens integrated `ConfigurationPanel` with currently available/read-only data
- `/changelog`
- `/hotkeys` fully opens `ShortcutHelp` programmatically

Tests:

- `/copy` copies last assistant text and handles no-message/clipboard-failure cases.
- `/session` opens a rich info dialog with available session fields.
- `/name` without args opens input dialog; with args renames immediately.
- `/settings` opens configuration UI, not fallback notice.
- `/changelog` displays markdown through `MarkdownDialog` and sanitizes/escapes unsafe content.

Exit criteria:

- The WUI has a coherent modal/dialog pattern.
- Low-risk commands no longer show “recognized in TUI but not implemented.”

### Phase 3 — Simple server-backed session-local operations

Purpose: introduce adapter/API parity for operations that act on the current session without replacing the active runtime/session.

Deliverables:

- Extend `PiSessionHandle`, `SessionRegistry`, HTTP API, and mock adapter for session-local operations.
- Add server route tests before React wiring.
- Add progress/error UI for longer operations.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/compact [instructions]`
- `/export [path]`
- `/reload` resource refresh skeleton
- dynamic prompt/template/skill command pass-through via `get_commands`

Notes:

- `/changelog` can be Phase 2 if implemented as read-only file fetch; otherwise keep here if exposed through server package metadata.
- Dynamic commands should be displayed in help/autocomplete and passed through to `api.prompt(sessionId, originalSlashText)`.

Tests:

- Mock adapter tests for compact/export/reload/get_commands.
- HTTP API tests for success, unknown session, and path policy denial.
- UI tests for compact instructions dialog, progress state, success summary, and errors.
- Dynamic command tests for extension/prompt/skill command autocomplete and pass-through.

Exit criteria:

- The WUI can safely call non-trivial Pi operations through typed API methods.
- The mock adapter supports all new operations deterministically.

### Phase 4 — Model/config/auth commands

Purpose: handle commands that mutate persistent settings, credentials, model scoping, or resource configuration.

Deliverables:

- Auth provider inventory.
- API-key login/logout flows.
- OAuth flow if practical.
- Scoped model multi-select/reorder UI.
- Real settings read/update for high-value settings.
- Resource diagnostics surfaced in `ConfigurationPanel`.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/scoped-models`
- `/login`
- `/logout`
- real writable `/settings` sections
- fuller `/reload` diagnostics if not completed in Phase 3

Tests:

- Auth state tests ported from `oauth-selector.test.ts`:
  - stored API key
  - OAuth/subscription credentials
  - environment keys
  - models.json key/command
  - unconfigured providers
- Scoped model ordering tests ported from regression `3217`.
- Settings persistence tests using temp agent/project dirs.
- Missing credentials/unavailable model UI tests.

Exit criteria:

- Settings/auth/model operations are secure, persisted where expected, and clearly distinguish environment vs stored credentials.

### Phase 5 — Tree and branch workflows

Purpose: implement core Pi branching/session-tree features after the command infrastructure and adapter pattern are stable.

Deliverables:

- Wire `SessionTree` into a modal/side panel.
- Add tree conversion APIs and mock tree data.
- Support labels, filters, branch summary choices, and prompt draft restoration.
- Add fork/clone API methods.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/tree`
- `/fork`
- `/clone`

Tests:

- Tree conversion unit tests.
- `SessionTree` UI tests porting key TUI selector invariants:
  - nearest visible ancestor for metadata leaves
  - filter switching preserves nearest visible ancestor
  - user entries restore editor text
  - non-user entries leave editor empty
  - summary options are passed correctly
  - labels save/clear
- Fork tests porting `agent-session-branching.test.ts` behavior at adapter/mock level.
- Clone tests porting `interactive-mode-clone-command.test.ts`.
- E2E mock-session flow: create session, send prompts, tree/fork/clone.

Exit criteria:

- Branching workflows are usable from mobile/touch UI, not just keyboard shortcuts.
- The WUI behavior is documented where it differs from TUI runtime replacement.

### Phase 6 — Resume/import/session replacement semantics

Purpose: tackle the commands where TUI semantics and WUI multi-session semantics differ most.

Deliverables:

- Decide and document whether WUI slash commands mean:
  - activate another dashboard session, or
  - perform exact Pi `AgentSessionRuntime` replacement semantics.
- Implement session picker dialog extracted from/reusing sidebar behavior.
- Add import JSONL flow with strict path policy.
- Strengthen `/new` semantics if exact runtime replacement is desired.

Commands covered in this phase:

- `/resume`
- `/import <path>`
- stronger `/new` semantics if needed
- clarify `/quit` vs `/close` semantics

Tests:

- Resume picker tests ported from:
  - `session-selector-search.test.ts`
  - `session-selector-rename.test.ts`
  - `session-selector-path-delete.test.ts`
- Import parser/path tests ported from `interactive-mode-import-command.test.ts`:
  - quote stripping
  - apostrophe preservation
  - command token boundaries
  - missing file is non-fatal
- Runtime replacement/stale context tests if adopting exact Pi runtime behavior, porting regression `2860`.
- Path traversal denial tests.

Exit criteria:

- The semantics of switching/resuming/importing are explicit and tested.
- The UI cannot import or switch to disallowed host paths.

### Phase 7 — Share and package-adjacent features

Purpose: leave high-risk upload/install behavior until local/session parity is solid.

Deliverables:

- Decide whether `/share` is supported or an explicit non-goal for private Tailscale deployments.
- Hide, disable, or fully secure package-management equivalents.
- Add audit-friendly confirmations for any upload/install behavior.

Commands/features covered in this phase:

- `/share`
- package management equivalents, if ever added
- trusted package/resource install/remove/update/config flows

Tests if `/share` is deferred:

- `/share` shows explicit unsupported/deferred message.
- No network/upload API is called.

Tests if `/share` is implemented:

- Disabled unless server config enables it.
- Confirmation explains destination and privacy.
- API called only after confirmation.
- API errors are visible and local session state is preserved.

Exit criteria:

- Dangerous operations are opt-in, policy-controlled, and test-covered.

### Recommended first PR

The first PR should be intentionally narrow:

1. Add slash parser and command registry.
2. Replace the dashboard slash switch with registry dispatch.
3. Add `DialogShell`, `SearchableSelectDialog`, and command help dialog.
4. Implement `/help` from registry metadata.
5. Improve `/model [query]` by pre-filling model search.
6. Implement `/copy` if it can be done using already loaded messages; otherwise leave it for Phase 2.

This first PR creates the stable pattern for every later command without blocking on SDK/runtime complexity.

## Server/API route sketch

Keep existing routes, then add:

```text
GET  /api/sessions/:id/stats
GET  /api/sessions/:id/last-assistant-text
GET  /api/sessions/:id/commands
POST /api/sessions/:id/compact
POST /api/sessions/:id/export
GET  /api/sessions/:id/tree
POST /api/sessions/:id/tree/navigate
POST /api/sessions/:id/tree/label
GET  /api/sessions/:id/fork-messages
POST /api/sessions/:id/fork
POST /api/sessions/:id/clone
POST /api/sessions/switch
POST /api/sessions/import
GET  /api/config
POST /api/config/settings
POST /api/config/reload
GET  /api/auth/providers
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
GET  /api/changelog
```

Long term, consider moving these to the existing WebSocket protocol once the WUI is ready for full-duplex command handling.

## Existing tests to reuse and port

There are two useful test sources:

1. This repo's current WUI/unit/e2e tests.
2. Pi's own TUI/SDK/RPC tests inside `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `pi-mono`.

The goal should not be to copy TUI implementation tests mechanically. Instead, extract behavioral invariants from the TUI tests and write WUI-first tests that prove the same outcomes through browser-visible UI and server API contracts.

### Current WUI tests in this repo

Existing tests already cover many reusable components and should become the base for slash-command TDD:

| Test file | Current coverage | Slash-command relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Pi TUI/SDK/RPC tests to mine for behavior

Relevant upstream tests found in `pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/test`:

| Upstream test | Behavior to port to WUI tests |
| --- | --- |
| `interactive-mode-import-command.test.ts` | `/import` and `/export` path parsing strips quotes, preserves apostrophes, enforces command token boundaries, confirms import, handles missing files non-fatally |
| `interactive-mode-clone-command.test.ts` | `/clone` forks current leaf with `{ position: "at" }`, clears editor, shows success, and handles empty session with “Nothing to clone yet” |
| `interactive-mode-compaction.test.ts` | `compaction_end` rebuilds chat and appends a synthetic compaction summary message |
| `tree-selector.test.ts` | Tree selector chooses nearest visible ancestor for metadata leaves; filter switching preserves nearest visible parent; tree navigation UI invariants |
| `agent-session-tree-navigation.test.ts` | Navigating to user messages restores editor text; navigating to assistant/non-user entries leaves editor empty; branch summaries attach at correct parent; no-op navigation; custom summary instructions |
| `agent-session-branching.test.ts` | Forking from user messages; forking from middle of conversation; selected text returned; new session state after fork |
| `session-selector-search.test.ts` | `/resume` search supports quoted phrase normalization, `re:` regex, invalid regex empty result, relevance/recent sorting, named-only filter |
| `session-selector-rename.test.ts` | Resume picker rename mode and rename callback behavior |
| `session-selector-path-delete.test.ts` | Resume picker delete confirmation, scope toggling current/all, async load race behavior, symlink/parent path handling |
| `oauth-selector.test.ts` | `/login`/`/logout` auth states distinguish API key, OAuth subscription, env vars, models.json keys/commands, and unconfigured providers |
| `suite/regressions/3217-scoped-model-order.test.ts` | Scoped model reordering persists and `/model` scoped tab preserves configured order |
| `suite/regressions/2753-reload-stale-resource-settings.test.ts` | `/reload` applies updated prompt/resource settings after startup |
| `resource-loader.test.ts` | Extension command collisions receive suffixes (`deploy:1`, `deploy:2`); registered command ordering; resource overrides/discovery |
| `rpc.test.ts` and `rpc-client*.test.ts` | RPC command semantics for `compact`, `bash`, state, messages, clone, and command responses |
| `agent-session-compaction.test.ts`, `compaction-extensions.test.ts` | Manual compaction result shape, cancellation, extension-provided compaction, error behavior |
| `agent-session-stats.test.ts` | `/session` stats: tokens, cost, context usage, message/tool counts |
| `export-html-*` tests | Export output security/formatting/XSS safety; useful for `/export` download route tests |
| `settings-manager.test.ts`, `settings-manager-bug.test.ts` | Settings merge/persistence/update behavior for `/settings` |
| `prompt-templates.test.ts`, `skills.test.ts`, `sdk-skills.test.ts` | Dynamic prompt/skill command discovery and expansion behavior |
| `suite/regressions/2023-queued-slash-command-followup.test.ts` | Extension-origin queued slash-command follow-ups should be raw user text, not accidentally re-dispatched |
| `suite/regressions/2860-replaced-session-context.test.ts` | Replacement-session contexts become stale after new/fork/switch/reload; important if WUI adopts runtime replacement semantics |
| `suite/regressions/3688-tree-cancel-compacting.test.ts` | Tree navigation cancellation while compacting/branch summarizing |

### TUI-to-WUI test-porting principles

For each upstream TUI test, port at one of three layers:

1. **Pure behavior tests** — parsers, registry, data transforms, path parsing, tree conversion.
2. **Server/adapter tests** — exact SDK/RPC operation is invoked; path policies and error mapping are enforced.
3. **React/browser tests** — user types `/command`, sees a dialog/panel, confirms/selects, and observes browser-visible state.

Prefer one test at each layer for high-risk commands instead of many brittle UI tests.

Do not port terminal-specific assertions such as ANSI text, raw key escape codes, line width, or border rendering. Translate them into web-equivalent assertions:

| TUI assertion | WUI assertion |
| --- | --- |
| Rendered output contains `ctrl+r rename` | Dialog exposes visible Rename button/help text and keyboard shortcut metadata |
| Raw key `Ctrl+D` enters delete confirmation | User clicks Delete or presses configured shortcut and sees `alertdialog` |
| Selector selected row changes | Listbox option has `aria-selected` / details pane updates |
| Editor text is set | `PromptComposer` draft value changes |
| `showStatus("...")` called | Toast/notice region has message |
| TUI custom dialog returns value | Web modal resolves callback/API call with selected value |
| Component render contains provider status | Auth panel displays status text/badge with accessible name |

## TDD test matrix for slash-command implementation

Write these tests before or alongside implementation. Mark tests `it.todo` or `describe.skip` only if the infrastructure does not exist yet; otherwise prefer failing tests that define the desired behavior.

### Foundation tests

#### Slash parser and registry

File: `tests/unit/slash-command-registry.test.ts`

- Parses `/model sonnet` as `{ name: "model", argv: "sonnet" }`.
- Parses `/name Feature work` preserving spaces in argv.
- Does not treat normal text containing `/` as a slash command unless it starts with `/`.
- Registry resolves aliases (`/models`, `/info`, `/close`) to canonical commands.
- Registry returns built-in command metadata for help/autocomplete.
- Registry merges dynamic commands after built-ins and handles name collisions deterministically.
- Unknown slash command shows a WUI notice and is not sent to Pi automatically.
- Dynamic slash command that is not WUI built-in is passed through to `api.prompt(sessionId, originalText)`.

#### Shared dialogs

Files:

- `tests/unit/dialog-shell.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/searchable-select-dialog.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/command-help-dialog.test.tsx`

Tests:

- Dialogs use `role="dialog"` or `role="alertdialog"`, `aria-modal`, accessible labels, close button.
- Escape and close button dismiss.
- Searchable select filters by label/description and exposes empty state.
- Enter/click selects item; disabled items cannot be selected.
- Mobile-friendly actions are visible; no keyboard-only affordance.
- Command help lists built-ins, aliases, and dynamic commands with source badges.

### `/model` and `/scoped-models`

Files:

- `tests/unit/model-picker.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/session-dashboard-slash-commands.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/scoped-models-dialog.test.tsx`

Tests:

- Typing `/model sonnet` opens `ModelPicker` with search prefilled to `sonnet` and does not call `api.prompt`.
- Selecting an available model calls `api.setModel(sessionId, provider, modelId)` and updates active session model.
- Unavailable models render disabled with a reason.
- `/scoped-models` opens multi-select model dialog.
- Reordering scoped models preserves order, porting upstream `3217-scoped-model-order` behavior.
- Persisting scoped models calls API with ordered provider/model IDs.

### `/settings`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/reload`

Files:

- Extend `tests/unit/configuration-panel.test.tsx`.
- Add `tests/unit/auth-panel.test.tsx` if auth is extracted.
- Add server tests for settings/auth/reload endpoints.

Tests:

- `/settings` opens a configuration dialog/panel, not a fallback notice.
- `/login` opens Auth tab/provider selector.
- Auth provider states distinguish stored API key, OAuth/subscription, environment key, models.json key/command, and unconfigured provider, porting `oauth-selector.test.ts`.
- `/logout` asks for provider and confirmation before removing stored credentials.
- Environment credentials are displayed as env-backed and cannot be removed by logout.
- `/reload` calls reload API, refreshes command suggestions, and displays resource diagnostics.
- Reload applies changed prompt/resource settings, porting regression `2753` at adapter/server level.

### `/compact`

Files:

- `tests/unit/session-dashboard-slash-commands.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/message-timeline.test.tsx`
- Server/adapter compact tests

Tests:

- `/compact` opens custom-instructions dialog when no argv is supplied.
- `/compact focus on files` calls `api.compact(sessionId, "focus on files")` immediately or after confirmation, depending final UX.
- While compacting, session status becomes `compacting` and a progress UI is visible.
- On success, messages/state refresh and a compaction summary appears in timeline, porting `interactive-mode-compaction.test.ts`.
- On cancellation/error, previous messages remain and an error notice is shown.
- Mock adapter records compaction result shape: `summary`, `firstKeptEntryId`, `tokensBefore`, `details`.

### `/session`

Files:

- `tests/unit/session-info-dialog.test.tsx`
- Dashboard slash tests
- Server stats tests

Tests:

- `/session` opens dialog showing session ID, cwd, file, name, model, status.
- Stats include user/assistant/tool counts, token totals, cost, context usage where available.
- Copy buttons copy session ID/file path and report success/failure.
- Missing stats degrade gracefully.

### `/copy`

Files:

- Dashboard slash tests

Tests:

- `/copy` copies last assistant text from loaded messages if available.
- If messages are not loaded or stale, calls `api.getLastAssistantText(sessionId)`.
- If no assistant message exists, shows a non-error notice.
- Clipboard failure shows an actionable error/fallback.
- It never sends `/copy` to the model.

### `/hotkeys`, `/help`, `/changelog`

Files:

- `tests/unit/shortcut-help.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/command-help-dialog.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/markdown-dialog.test.tsx`

Tests:

- `/hotkeys` opens the same shortcut help as `?`.
- `/help` opens command help generated from registry and dynamic commands.
- `/changelog` fetches changelog markdown and displays it in a markdown dialog.
- Changelog rendering sanitizes/escapes unsafe HTML if markdown HTML is supported.

### `/tree`

Files:

- Extend `tests/unit/session-tree.test.tsx`.
- Add `tests/unit/session-tree-data.test.ts` for conversion from Pi entries.
- Add server/adapter tree tests.

Tests:

- `/tree` opens `SessionTree` modal with entries from API.
- Current leaf is highlighted; if current leaf is metadata, nearest visible ancestor is selected, porting `tree-selector.test.ts`.
- Filter changes (`default`, `no-tools`, `user-only`, `labeled-only`, `all`) preserve nearest visible ancestor where possible.
- Selecting a user entry calls `onRestoreUserMessage` and pre-fills `PromptComposer` draft.
- Selecting an assistant/tool/summary entry does not prefill draft.
- Navigating with no summary creates no summary entry.
- Navigating with default/custom summary calls API with correct options.
- Custom summary instructions are preserved.
- Label save/clear calls API and updates UI.
- Cancelled branch summarization leaves UI/session unchanged.

### `/fork` and `/clone`

Files:

- Dashboard slash tests
- `tests/unit/fork-message-dialog.test.tsx`
- Server/adapter fork/clone tests

Tests:

- `/fork` opens user-message picker from `api.getForkMessages(sessionId)`.
- Selecting a message calls `api.forkSession(sessionId, entryId)`.
- New fork session is added/activated.
- Selected text is restored into prompt draft when API returns it, matching Pi behavior.
- Forking from middle of conversation preserves prior context, covered at adapter/mock level.
- `/clone` asks for confirmation if desired, then calls `api.cloneSession(sessionId)`.
- Clone with no current leaf shows “Nothing to clone yet,” porting `interactive-mode-clone-command.test.ts`.
- Clone success clears draft and activates new session.

### `/resume`, `/new`, `/name`, `/quit`

Files:

- Dashboard tests
- `tests/unit/resume-session-dialog.test.tsx`
- Existing session sidebar tests can be extracted/reused

Tests:

- `/resume` opens session picker with current/all scope, search, sort, named filter.
- Search supports quoted phrase normalization and `re:` regex; invalid regex returns empty result, porting `session-selector-search.test.ts`.
- Picker supports rename and delete confirmation as visible controls, porting `session-selector-rename` and `session-selector-path-delete` behavior.
- Async “all sessions” load resolving after switching back to current scope does not overwrite current scope.
- Selecting a session activates it and loads messages.
- `/new` opens create-session dialog with cwd defaulted from active session.
- `/name` with no argv opens input dialog; `/name Some Name` renames immediately.
- `/quit` behavior is clarified in tests once product semantics are decided. Until then, test current alias behavior as `/close` and avoid destructive delete surprises.

### `/export` and `/import`

Files:

- `tests/unit/export-dialog.test.tsx`
- `tests/unit/import-dialog.test.tsx`
- Parser/path tests
- Server path-policy tests

Tests:

- Shared parser strips quotes for `/export "path with spaces/out.html"` and `/import "path with spaces/session.jsonl"`.
- Parser preserves apostrophes in unquoted paths.
- Parser enforces command token boundaries: `/exporter` and `/important` are not parsed as `/export` or `/import`, porting `interactive-mode-import-command.test.ts`.
- `/export` without path opens dialog/default export action.
- Export success returns a download link or path notice.
- Export route denies output outside allowed export root unless explicitly configured.
- `/import` without path opens path dialog.
- `/import <path>` asks confirmation before replacing/activating session.
- Missing import file is shown as non-fatal error.
- Invalid JSONL is shown as validation error.
- Import path traversal is denied.

### `/share`

Files:

- Dashboard slash tests
- Server share tests if implemented

Tests if deferred:

- `/share` shows explicit “not supported in WUI yet” message with no upload side effects.

Tests if implemented:

- Share is disabled unless a server config flag is enabled.
- Confirmation explains upload destination and privacy.
- Share calls API only after confirmation.
- API errors are visible and do not lose local export.

### Dynamic commands: extension, prompt, skill

Files:

- Registry tests
- Dashboard tests
- API tests for `get_commands`
- Extension UI host tests

Tests:

- `api.getCommands(sessionId)` results appear in autocomplete/help with source labels.
- Duplicate extension command names use suffixed invocation names (`deploy:1`, `deploy:2`) and preserve ordering, porting `resource-loader.test.ts`.
- Prompt template and skill commands are displayed as dynamic commands.
- Selecting/typing a dynamic command passes original slash text to `api.prompt` and does not show WUI fallback.
- Dynamic command UI requests are rendered by `ExtensionUiHost`.
- Extension-origin queued slash-command follow-ups are treated as raw user text, not re-dispatched as WUI commands, porting regression `2023`.

## Testing strategy

- Keep the mock adapter deterministic and feature-complete for every new command.
- Unit-test command registry independently from React.
- Unit-test each dialog component independently.
- Add dashboard integration tests for slash-command entry points.
- Add server tests for path policies and session lifecycle operations.
- Add Playwright smoke tests for mobile-sized viewport command flows.
- Do not require real LLM/API credentials for default tests.
- Treat Pi TUI/SDK/RPC tests as behavior specs; link or cite the source test when porting a behavior.
- For every command, add tests in this order: parser/registry, mock API/adapter, React UI, then e2e smoke if the flow is important on mobile.
- Keep upstream LLM-dependent cases as adapter contract tests with mock data unless explicitly marked integration.

## Security and product guardrails

- Browser must never request arbitrary host paths without server policy approval.
- Import/export/share need explicit UI warnings and safe defaults.
- Package install/remove should remain hidden or disabled until trust model is designed.
- Auth changes should distinguish environment credentials from stored credentials.
- Share/upload must be opt-in and audit-friendly.
- Commands that mutate sessions (`/compact`, `/tree`, `/fork`, `/clone`, `/import`, `/new`, `/resume`) should confirm when risk is high or when active work is streaming.
- Every keyboard shortcut should have a visible touch equivalent.

## Open questions

1. Should `/quit` delete/dispose the active session, close the browser connection, or stop the server? Current WUI behavior maps it to close/delete; this should be renamed or clarified.
2. Should `/resume`, `/new`, `/fork`, `/clone`, and `/import` use exact Pi runtime replacement semantics or WUI multi-session activation semantics?
3. Should `/share` be supported at all in a private Tailscale-first app?
4. Should `/export` allow arbitrary output paths, or only download/generated export locations?
5. Should the WUI eventually consume Pi RPC mode directly instead of maintaining an SDK adapter?
6. How much of package management belongs in this WUI, given the security implications of installing executable extensions remotely?
