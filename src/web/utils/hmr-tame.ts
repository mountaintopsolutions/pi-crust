/**
 * Suppress Vite's reload-on-disconnect behavior.
 *
 * Vite's HMR client calls `location.reload()` whenever it can't refresh a
 * module via in-place HMR — most commonly when its WebSocket disconnects.
 * On desktop this is mildly annoying; on iOS Safari it's catastrophic
 * because Safari suspends the WS the moment a tab goes background, and
 * resuming the tab triggers a full reload that destroys scroll position
 * and any composer draft. Telemetry showed every observed "random refresh"
 * on the WUI was this exact code path.
 *
 * Fix: intercept Vite's `vite:beforeFullReload` event and cancel it when
 * the reload would be due to a transient disconnect (tab in the background
 * or having just resumed). On true config-level changes while the tab is
 * actively in the foreground we still allow the reload, because that's the
 * only way to pick up some non-hot-reloadable edits.
 *
 * Reference: https://vite.dev/guide/api-hmr.html — `vite:beforeFullReload`
 * is a documented event that supports `event.preventDefault()`.
