# pi-remote-control plan

A mobile-first, self-hosted web control plane for running many concurrent Pi coding-agent sessions from a browser, intended to be accessed remotely over Tailscale.

The design goal is not to mirror Pi's terminal TUI through `xterm.js`; instead, the web app should treat Pi's TUI as the behavioral specification and use the Pi SDK/RPC event model as the structured interface.

## Guiding principles

- Use `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` as a library via the SDK where possible.
- Do not fork Pi unless core protocol changes become necessary.
- Prefer structured Pi events over terminal scraping.
- Support many independent sessions concurrently.
- Keep mobile approval/steering workflows first-class.
- Treat the existing Pi TUI features as the parity baseline, but do not let full parity block the first useful release.
- Build test-first around event streams, state reducers, and browser flows.
- Keep Tailscale deployment simple: bind locally or on tailnet interface, add app-level auth token anyway.
- Keep the Pi integration behind an adapter boundary so a mock adapter, SDK adapter, and possible RPC adapter can share the same web/server protocol.

## Product cut-lines

The plan is intentionally comprehensive. Implementation should be staged by usable product cut-lines so the project does not stall chasing full TUI parity before becoming useful.

### Cut-line A — local proof of life

A developer can run the server locally, create one Pi session, send a prompt, and see streamed assistant output in the browser.

Required phases/features:

- Minimal Phase 0
- Minimal Phase 1
- Minimal Phase 2
- A tiny subset of Phase 3 and Phase 4

### Cut-line B — remote mobile supervisor

A developer can access the app over Tailscale from a phone, see multiple sessions, steer/follow-up/abort, and approve extension prompts.

Required phases/features:

- Phase 3 dashboard
- Phase 6 queue/composer basics
- Phase 7 extension UI primitives
- Phase 12 auth/reconnect/mobile basics

### Cut-line C — TUI parity MVP

The WUI covers the high-value Pi TUI behaviors: sessions, streaming, tools, queues, model/thinking controls, settings basics, compaction, and tree/fork/clone.

Required phases/features:

- Phases 3–10, excluding package management and advanced theming if needed

### Cut-line D — better-than-TUI parallel coding

The WUI adds workflows the TUI does not emphasize: side-by-side sessions, git/worktree orchestration, approval inbox, push notifications, and cost/admin dashboards.

Required phases/features:

- Phase 11
- Phase 12
- selected later enhancements

## Cross-cutting requirements

These apply to all phases.

- Protocol messages must be versioned so old browser tabs fail gracefully after server upgrades.
- Browser state must be reconstructible from server state after refresh/reconnect.
- Large streams and tool outputs must have backpressure/truncation rules.
- Server APIs that touch the filesystem must enforce cwd/root allowlists.
- Browser clients must never be allowed to request arbitrary host paths unless explicitly permitted by server policy.
- All dangerous operations need explicit UI affordances and audit-friendly logs.
- Tests should not require real LLM API calls unless explicitly marked integration/e2e.
- A deterministic mock Pi adapter should exist before the web UI becomes complex.
- The app should prefer progressive enhancement on mobile: every shortcut must have a visible touch UI equivalent.

- [ ] Errors.
- [ ] Compaction summaries.
- [ ] Branch summaries.
- [ ] Collapsible/expandable tool output.

## Editor/composer parity

- [ ] Multiline input.
- [ ] Submit vs newline controls.
- [ ] Steering vs follow-up while streaming.

- [ ] Path completion.
- [ ] Slash command completion.
- [ ] Prompt templates.
- [ ] Skill commands.
- [ ] Extension commands.
- [ ] Image paste/upload/drag-drop/mobile camera.
- [ ] `!command` shell execution.
- [ ] `!!command` hidden shell execution.
- [ ] Abort bash execution.
- [ ] External-editor equivalent for long input.
- [ ] Prompt history and draft persistence.

## Footer/status parity

- [ ] cwd.
- [ ] git branch.
- [ ] session name.
- [ ] session id/file details.
- [ ] current model.
- [ ] thinking level.
- [ ] token/cache usage.
- [ ] cost.
- [ ] context usage.
- [ ] streaming/working indicator.
- [ ] compaction/retry state.
- [ ] extension status entries.
- [ ] extension widgets above/below composer.

## Built-in command parity

- [ ] `/login` and `/logout` equivalents.
- [ ] `/model` equivalent.
- [ ] `/scoped-models` equivalent.
- [ ] `/settings` equivalent.
- [ ] `/resume` equivalent.
- [ ] `/new` equivalent.
- [ ] `/name` equivalent.
- [ ] `/session` equivalent.
- [ ] `/tree` equivalent.
- [ ] `/fork` equivalent.
- [ ] `/clone` equivalent.
- [ ] `/compact` equivalent.
- [ ] `/copy` equivalent.
- [ ] `/export` equivalent.
- [ ] `/share` equivalent or explicit non-goal.
- [ ] `/reload` equivalent.
- [ ] `/hotkeys` equivalent.
- [ ] `/changelog` equivalent.
- [ ] `/quit` has a WUI analog: close/dispose session or disconnect.

## Package/resource parity

- [ ] `pi install` equivalent for trusted package sources.
- [ ] `pi remove` equivalent.
- [ ] `pi update` equivalent.
- [ ] `pi list` equivalent.
- [ ] `pi config` equivalent for enabling/disabling package resources.
- [ ] Explicit security warnings for packages/extensions because they execute code.

## Settings parity

- [ ] Model/thinking settings.
- [ ] UI/display settings.
- [ ] Theme settings.
- [ ] Compaction settings.
- [ ] Branch summary settings.
- [ ] Retry settings.
- [ ] Message delivery settings.
- [ ] Terminal/image settings mapped to web semantics.
- [ ] Shell settings.
- [ ] Session directory setting.
- [ ] Enabled/scoped models.
- [ ] Markdown settings.
- [ ] Resource path/package settings.
- [ ] Telemetry/update-check settings.
- [ ] Warning settings.

## Known intentional gaps

- [ ] Full terminal `ctx.ui.custom()` component rendering is not planned for v1.
- [ ] Native terminal cursor/IME mechanics are replaced by browser input behavior.
- [ ] Terminal ANSI rendering is replaced by native web components.
- [ ] Shell job control/suspend is not meaningful in WUI.

# Risk register

## Risk: SDK APIs shift while Pi evolves

Mitigation:

- Keep all direct Pi SDK calls inside a small adapter.
- Prefer documented APIs.
- Add adapter contract tests.
- Consider an RPC adapter if SDK coupling becomes painful.

## Risk: full TUI parity delays useful mobile workflow

Mitigation:

- Follow product cut-lines.
- Ship remote mobile supervisor before full settings/package/theme parity.
- Keep final parity checklist separate from MVP scope.

## Risk: filesystem exposure over remote UI

Mitigation:

- Require project root allowlists.
- Never expose arbitrary server file pickers by default.
- Add explicit read-only mode.
- Log dangerous operations and approval decisions.

## Risk: many concurrent agents overload machine or provider limits

Mitigation:

- Add per-session and global concurrency limits.
- Show running bash/LLM operations in admin UI.
- Add cost dashboard and provider retry visibility.
- Support idle disposal.

## Risk: extension UI compatibility diverges from TUI behavior

Mitigation:

- Use an `rpc-demo`-style fixture as a compatibility test.
- Document unsupported terminal-only `ctx.ui.custom()` behavior.
- Prefer web-native primitives for approvals/status/widgets.

# Open design questions

- [ ] SDK-only, RPC-only, or hybrid backend?
  - Current preference: SDK-first, optional RPC adapter later.
- [ ] How much of Pi extension UI should be supported initially?
  - Current preference: support RPC-compatible primitives early; defer full custom TUI component analog.
- [ ] Should sessions be isolated by git worktree by default?
  - Current preference: optional in early versions, recommended for parallel coding later.
- [ ] Should the server support multiple users or just one trusted tailnet user?
  - Current preference: single-user first, but keep session ownership in data model.
- [ ] Should session files remain in Pi's default directory or app-specific directory?
  - Current preference: Pi default initially for interoperability; allow custom session dir later.
- [ ] Should web-native commands exactly mirror slash commands or expose richer menus?
  - Current preference: both; slash palette plus native buttons/modals.
- [ ] How should cwd selection be secured?
  - Need an allowlist/root directory policy before exposing remotely.

# Non-goals for the first version

- Full terminal/TUI emulation through xterm.js.
- Multi-user cloud service.
- Public internet exposure without Tailscale or equivalent private network.
- Maintaining a fork of Pi.
- Implementing Pi's `ctx.ui.custom()` terminal component API directly in web.
- Perfect parity with every TUI keyboard shortcut on mobile.
