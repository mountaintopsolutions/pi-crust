/**
 * Per-test process & tmpdir hygiene guard, scoped to known-problematic
 * process patterns.
 *
 * THE RULE: a test must leave the system in the state it found it. Anything
 * spawned, written, or bound during the test is owned by the test and must
 * be released, or the test fails.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ----------------
 * Some of our tests deliberately spawn detached helper processes —
 * notably scripts/dev-api.mjs, which forks its child with detached:true so
 * production deploys can survive parent shell death. That's intentional in
 * production; but in tests it means an afterEach that does `supervisor.kill()`
 * on a ChildProcess handle does NOT reap the supervisor's detached
 * grandchildren. If the test then exits abnormally (vitest timeout, OOM,
 * SIGKILL), nothing reaps anything. We learned this the hard way:
 *
 *   2026-05-23: a chaos test in test/supervisor-runner-puller-hardening
 *   spawned dev-api.mjs in a /tmp/fs-chaos-cyclic-nm-XXXXXX sandbox, the
 *   test runner died, the orphaned supervisor sat in a respawn loop for
 *   2h18m at 99% CPU until a human noticed.
 *
 * Scoping: only patterns we've actually seen cause outages
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * A previous draft of this guard tried to flag ANY new descendant of the
 * test runner. That triggered false positives all over the suite (vitest's
 * own worker forks, ts-node loaders, test-internal subprocess spawns we
 * didn't author) and made it flake. The current version only flags
 * processes whose argv matches LEAK_PATTERNS — the exact shapes that have
 * caused production outages. New shapes can be added as new outages teach
 * us. False positives on unrelated subprocesses are structurally impossible.
 *
 * Two guards, two failure modes
 * ------------------------------
 *  (1) afterEach pattern scan  — any process matching a known-leak argv
 *                                pattern that didn't exist at suite start
 *                                is a test leak. Catches both live
 *                                descendants AND orphans already at PPID=1.
 *  (2) afterAll tmpdir reaper  — catches /tmp/<test-prefix>-XXXXXX dirs
 *                                that survived a hard kill of the framework.
 *
 * Contract for test authors
 * --------------------------
 *   - You may spawn anything you want. As long as anything matching
 *     LEAK_PATTERNS has been killed before your test's afterEach returns
 *     (with a small grace window for the kernel to reap it), the guard is
 *     silent.
 *   - If you intentionally spawn a long-lived helper that should outlive a
 *     single test, scope it with beforeAll/afterAll and reap it in afterAll.
 *   - If you create a tmpdir, name it with one of the registered prefixes
 *     (TMP_PREFIXES) so the afterAll reaper picks up stragglers.
 *   - To add a new leak class: append its argv-substring marker to
 *     LEAK_PATTERNS. Avoid overly broad markers ("node", "/scripts/").
