/**
 * These tests cover the bash-style "the tool call should fail if its inputs
 * are wrong" validation we added to `show_artifact`. The motivating bug:
 * passing a `path` that the pi-crust can't actually fetch over HTTP silently
 * produced a broken-image artifact instead of an obvious tool failure.
 *
 * The behavior we want:
 *   - kind=image with a missing path  -> throws (tool call fails)
 *   - kind=image with a path outside the allow-list -> throws
 *   - kind=image with a valid path -> details.path is absolute and
 *     details.url is /api/artifact-file?path=<abs>
 *   - kind=markdown IS now file-backable: a `path` (with no inline `markdown`)
 *     is validated against the same allow-list AND the file contents are
 *     INLINED into details.markdown, because the web markdown renderer needs
 *     the inline string (it never fetches a markdown URL). Missing/outside
 *     allow-list paths throw, mirroring image. Inline `markdown` still wins.
 *   - other non-file-backed artifacts (vega-lite, json, ...) are unaffected
