/**
 * Failing TDD spec: the WUI must not refetch the full `/messages` payload on
 * every SSE (re)connect.
 *
 * Symptom in production: the network panel shows two ~29 MB
 * `GET /api/sessions/:id/messages` calls back-to-back when opening a session
 * — one for initial mount and a second triggered by the SSE handshake. The
 * second call doubles network cost and CPU for no benefit, because the SSE
 * stream already replays missed events from the server-side ring.
 *
 * Contract pinned here: opening a single session in a fresh tab issues AT
 * MOST one /messages request for that session. Any further updates come over
 * the events stream.
 *
 * This test currently FAILS.
